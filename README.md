# **YOLOv8 Object Detection and Classification - Solar Panel Cleanliness Detection**



This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and classification to identify solar panels and classify them as either clean or dirty. The implementation is based on a restructured version of the YOLOv8 model using PyTorch, with training and deployment performed in Google Colab.



# Tools & Libraries Used


1.   Ultralytics YOLOv8
2.   OpenCV
3.   Roboflow (for dataset annotation and preparation)
4.   Google Colab (for training environment)



# Dataset

1.   Custom dataset annotated using Roboflow.
2.   Contains images of solar panels labeled as either clean or dirty.
1.   Dataset structure follows the YOLO format with:

├── images
│   ├── train
│   ├── val
├── labels
│   ├── train
│   ├── val

"""# Training


1.   Training was conducted on Google Colab.
2.   Command to train:
"""

from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO('yolov8n.yaml')  # or yolov8s, yolov8m, etc.
model.train(data='data.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)

model = YOLO('runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt')
results = model('your_image.jpg')
results.show()

"""# Summary
This implementation successfully detects solar panels and classifies them based on cleanliness using YOLOv8. The model can be further improved by increasing dataset size, applying augmentations, or using larger YOLOv8 models (e.g., yolov8l, yolov8x).
